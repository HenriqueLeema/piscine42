/*In this example, we declare str as the string we want to search in and to_find as 
the substring we want to find. We call ft_strstr with these arguments and store 
the result in a pointer variable called result.

We then check if result is NULL to see if to_find was found in str. If it was found, 
we use pointer arithmetic to calculate the position of the first character of to_find 
within str, and print the result. If it was not found, we print a message saying so.*/


/*Unlike those func‚Äê
     tions, strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the buffer (not just
     the length) and guarantee to NUL-terminate the result (as long as size is
     larger than 0 or, in the case of strlcat(), as long as there is at least
     one byte free in dst).  Note that a byte for the NUL should be included*/
